<p align="center">The ToDo app is a simple and intuitive task management tool designed to help you stay organized and productive. With this app, you can easily add, complete, and delete items from your to-do list, ensuring that you never miss an important task. To make this application I used flutter as programming language and VS code as text editor.</p>
